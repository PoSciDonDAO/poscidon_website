            Introducing PoSciDonDAO: The first community-owned collective
            funding personalized medicine research for life-altering diseases
          </h1>
          <span className="text">
            In 2020, there were approximately 19.3 million new cancer cases
            globally (<a href="#">Sung, Hyuna. et al., 2021</a>)
          </span>

          <span className="text">
            By 2050, 152 million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's disease
            or some other form of dementia (Nichols, Emma, et al., 2022).
          </span>

          <p className="text">
            These life-altering diseases are too familiar for many people
            nowadays. The older we get, the more people will be affected by
            these diseases. Unfortunately, these diseases have limited treatment
            options and new drugs have a high failure rate in clinical trials
            (Sun, Duxin, et al., 2022).

            Personalized medicine: the future of research and health care
          </h2>
          <p className="text">
            The only way to find a cure for these diseases is to perform
            ‘personalized medicine research’. Personalized medicine research
            focuses on identifying patient subpopulations based on their genetic
            background and many other patient characteristics (Goetz et al.,
            2018). For example, cancer drugs called Imatinib and Dasatinib
            seemed to be only effective in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
            patients that have a specific genetic mutation (Carlson, 2008).
            These drugs have saved thousands of patients with CML. This shows
            that personalized medicine research is the key to improving
            patients' lives.

            Getting funding for personalized medicine research - a worldwide
            issue
          </h2>
          <p className="text">
            Unfortunately, obtaining funding for personalized medicine research
            can be a daunting task, as the traditional funding process is often
            considered slow, time-consuming and requires substantial resources
            (Pew Research Center, 2009). In addition, a lot of personal and
            institutional bias infiltrates the funding process, making it even
            more difficult for researchers to obtain funding for their research.
            Another issue is the high retention of donated funds by fundraisers,
            resulting in only 40-60% of the funds going to charities and even
            lower amounts reaching the scientific community (James, 2022). This
            phenomenon heavily reduces the amount of personalized medicine
            research that can be done and limits societal innovation and
            progress.

            the Due Diligence crew or not. The Due Diligence crew is a network
            of personalized medicine research experts that source research
