            Our Due Diligence crew will go above and beyond for you to guarantee
            a fast and easy funding process for your project. Full transparency
            is reached as the Due Diligence crew votes on which research
            projects receive funding via smart contracts deployed on blockchain
            technology. As the Due Diligence crew consists of scientists with
            various backgrounds, bias is decreased in the funding process.
